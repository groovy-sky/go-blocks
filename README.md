# gotermtris

**GoTermTris** is a small weekend project to create a simple terminal-version 
of the classic game Tetris using Go.

Somewhat inspired by [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OK8_tHeCIA) 
little tutorial project doing the same in C++. And yes, I did peek and in 
places wholesale borrowed game-logic from his source, found 
[here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/OneLoneCoder_Tetris.cpp).

A few bells and whistles have been added such as a start-screen with top-5
list and having said list be saved on disk.
